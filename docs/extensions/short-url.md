## How to setup .htaccess file to use link slug in Short Urls
1. Log in to your FTP/SSH server.
2. Go to main directory of your EspoCRM.
3. Open .htaccess file.
4. Before `</IfModule>` add: `RewriteRule ^link/(.*)$ {CRM_URL}/api/v1/l/$1 [L]`. Of course you have to replace **{CRM_URL}** with your domain.  
Example: `RewriteRule ^link/(.*)$ https://demo.devcrm.it/api/v1/l/$1 [L]`

## How to change length of aliases?
1. Log in to SSH/FTP server.
2. Go to main directory of your EspoCRM.
3. Go to: `custom/Espo/Custom/Resources/metadata/app`. If any of these folders not exists, create it.
4. Create in this directory file called `dubasShortUrlOptions.json`.
5. In this file paste this:   
```
{
    "length": 10   
}
```
6. Log in to EspoCRM as admin and go to  **Administration -> Clear Cache** to clear cache.

That's it. Now all new url's will have ten characters. Of course you can change it to whatever you want. Just remember, that alias can't be too short, because after some time our extension will not be able to generate unique aliases.

## How to increase limit characters in Full Url field?
Current limit of characters in Full Url field is 300 characters. If you want to increase on your instance, you just have to add new value to Custom directory. To do so follow these steps:

1. Log in to your FTP/SSH server.
2. Go to main directory of your EspoCRM instance.
3. Go to `custom/Espo/Custom/Resources/metadata/entityDefs/`.
4. Create file `ShortUrl.json`.
5. Paste this in `ShortUrl.json`
```
{
    "fields": {
        "name": {
            "maxLength": 500
        }
    }   
}
```

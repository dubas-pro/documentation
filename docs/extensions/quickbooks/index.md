The QuickBooks Integration for EspoCRM enables seamless synchronization between your EspoCRM and QuickBooks Online. This integration allows businesses to manage invoices, payments, and customer records efficiently while ensuring data consistency across both platforms.

## :material-playlist-check: Requirements
- EspoCRM version 8.0.0 or higher.
- PHP version 8.1 or higher.
- Active QuickBooks Online account with API access.

## :material-view-grid-plus: Installation
1. Log in to your EspoCRM and go to the **Administration** section.
2. Navigate to the **Extensions** tab.
3. Install the extension provided by Dubas.

## :material-tune: Initial Configuration
1. Go to **Administration > Integrations**.
2. Select **QuickBooks Integration**.
3. Enable the integration.
4. Connect your QuickBooks account by entering the required API credentials.
5. Go to your user account in EspoCRM, click on **External Accounts** and choose **QuickBooks** from a list of integrations.
6. Enable integration and connect it to QuickBooks accounts.
7. Go to **Administration > QuickBooks Settings** and configure the synchronization settings for customers, invoices, and payments.
8. Save settings.

Now, you can start syncing financial data between EspoCRM and QuickBooks.

## :material-file-document-outline: How It Works
1. **Customer Sync:** When a new customer is created in EspoCRM, it will automatically be added to QuickBooks.
2. **Invoice Management:** Create invoices in EspoCRM and have them reflected in QuickBooks.
3. **Payment Synchronization:** Payments recorded in QuickBooks can be pulled into EspoCRM for accurate financial tracking.
4. **Two-Way Data Sync:** Ensure customer and financial data remains consistent between both systems.

## :material-alert-circle-outline: Limitations
- The integration supports **QuickBooks Online** and does not work with QuickBooks Desktop.

This integration simplifies financial management by bridging your CRM with accounting software, reducing manual data entry, and enhancing workflow automation.

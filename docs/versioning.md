# Versioning System for Dubas Extensions

At Dubas, we use a structured versioning format **M.M.P** (Major.Minor.Patch) to manage our EspoCRM extensions. This approach helps maintain clarity regarding the scope and significance of updates, ensuring that users can easily track changes and compatibility.

## :material-numeric-1-box-outline: Major Updates (M)
Major updates introduce significant changes that can include:
- New core features or substantial enhancements.
- Breaking changes that may affect compatibility.
- Major improvements to the user experience or integration scope.

### Example: `2.0.0`
A transition from version `1.x.x` to `2.0.0` indicates a complete overhaul or the addition of a crucial feature.

## :material-numeric-2-box-outline: Minor Updates (M)
Minor updates focus on:
- Adding new, backward-compatible features.
- Enhancements that expand existing functionalities.
- Improvements that do not disrupt the current setup.

### Example: `1.2.0`
An update from `1.1.0` to `1.2.0` reflects added functionalities that integrate smoothly without altering existing configurations.

## :material-numeric-3-box-outline: Patch Updates (P)
Patch updates are meant for:
- Bug fixes and minor performance improvements.
- Security patches to address vulnerabilities.
- Small adjustments that do not add new features.

### Example: `1.1.3`
An update from `1.1.2` to `1.1.3` indicates minor bug fixes or optimizations.

## :material-information-outline: Summary
- **Major** — Significant updates with potential breaking changes.
- **Minor** — Feature additions and enhancements without breaking existing functionalities.
- **Patch** — Small fixes and performance improvements.

This versioning strategy ensures consistent and predictable updates, allowing users to maintain and upgrade our extensions confidently.

# License Management System

## Overview

At **dubas.pro**, we developed a **custom License Management System** integrated into **EspoCRM** to streamline how we manage software licenses for our products and services. This tailored solution allows us to automatically issue, track, and notify customers about their software licenses, enhancing transparency and improving customer experience.

## 🎯 Purpose of the License Management System

- Centralize and automate license management for both publicly available and custom-developed extensions.
- Ensure timely and professional communication with customers regarding their license status.
- Offer a self-service customer dashboard with access to downloads, release notes, and updates.
- Maintain accurate records for billing, license types, and usage tracking.

## 🧩 Implementation Details

Our License Management System was built directly within **EspoCRM** using its extension development framework and custom entities. Key components include:

- **Custom License Entity**: Stores all relevant data about each software license.
- **Automation Workflows**: Handles post-purchase actions like email notifications and dashboard updates.
- **Customer Portal Integration**: Allows customers to log in and view/download licensed products.
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Monitor expiration dates and trigger renewal reminders.

## 📦 How the System Works

### 1. **Purchase via devcrm.it or Email**

- When a customer purchases a product through our website (**devcrm.it**) or directly by email:
  - A license is **automatically created** in EspoCRM.
  - The customer receives an **email with license details** and login credentials.
  - The product becomes available in the **customer dashboard**, along with access to:
    - Current and previous versions.
    - Associated release notes.

### 2. **Custom Development Deliveries**

- When a **custom extension** is developed for a client:
  - A dedicated license is created for that custom product.
  - All **future updates or revisions** are uploaded and visible in the customer dashboard.
  - Clients can download the **latest version with custom changes** at any time.

### 3. **Public Extension Updates**

- For all customers with active licenses for public extensions:
  - We send **email notifications** about new releases.
  - Customers can review **release notes** and download updates via the dashboard.

### 4. **License Expiration Notices**

- Automated **email reminders** are sent before a license expires.
- Customers are prompted to **renew** to maintain access to updates and support.

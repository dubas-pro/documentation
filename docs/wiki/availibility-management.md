# Availability Management in EspoCRM

## Executive Summary

Our organization has successfully integrated comprehensive availability management into our business operations through EspoCRM's Working Calendar feature. This implementation serves as the central hub for all availability-related information, ensuring consistent and accurate communication with customers while streamlining internal processes across multiple business functions.

## Overview of Our Implementation

### Strategic Approach

As part of our internal policy requiring all company information to be centralized in EspoCRM, we have developed a robust availability management system that extends beyond simple calendar functionality. Our implementation combines EspoCRM's native Working Calendar feature with external integrations to create a comprehensive availability ecosystem.

### Core Components

Our availability management system consists of three primary components:

- **EspoCRM Working Calendar**: Central repository for availability data
- **Cal.com Integration**: Real-time scheduling based on actual calendar availability
- **Multi-channel Availability Display**: Customer-facing availability information across various touchpoints

## Technical Implementation

### EspoCRM Working Calendar Configuration

#### Holiday Management
We maintain a comprehensive database of Polish national holidays within the Working Calendar system. This ensures that all availability calculations automatically account for statutory holidays without manual intervention.

**Key Features:**
- Complete Polish holiday calendar integration
- Automatic annual updates for recurring holidays
- Custom holiday addition capabilities for company-specific closures

#### Working Hours Definition
Our Working Calendar includes detailed specifications for:
- Standard business hours across different departments
- Flexible working arrangements for individual employees
- Seasonal hour adjustments when applicable

#### Leave Management
The system tracks various types of employee absences:
- Planned vacation time
- Sick leave
- Personal time off
- Training and conference attendance
- Other authorized absences

### Integration Points

#### Cal.com Self-Hosted Instance
While EspoCRM serves as our availability data repository, we utilize a self-hosted Cal.com instance for customer-facing scheduling. This dual approach provides:
- Real-time calendar synchronization
- Automated availability updates
- Seamless customer booking experience
- Reduced scheduling conflicts

## Business Process Integration

### Task Management System

#### Customer Status Page Enhancement
When customers register tasks in our system, they receive automated email notifications containing links to dedicated status pages. These pages feature:

**Real-Time Availability Display:**
- Current availability status of assigned employees
- Next available working day if employee is currently unavailable
- Estimated response times based on current workload and availability

**Customer Benefits:**
- Transparency in service delivery expectations
- Reduced uncertainty about task progression
- Improved customer satisfaction through proactive communication

### Ticketing System Integration

#### Intelligent Autoresponder System
Our ticketing system leverages availability data to provide contextually relevant automated responses:

**After-Hours Ticket Processing:**
- Automatic detection of tickets submitted outside business hours
- Customized responses indicating next business day for response
- Clear expectations for customer response timing

**Employee Unavailability Handling:**
- Automatic identification when assigned employee is not available
- Intelligent routing to available team members when possible
- Transparent communication about expected response delays

#### Smart Ticket Assignment
The system intelligently handles ticket assignment based on availability:
- Prevents assignment to unavailable employees
- Automatically escalates to available team members
- Maintains service level agreements through proactive management

### Customer-Facing Availability Display

#### Website Integration
Our company website features real-time availability information sourced directly from EspoCRM:

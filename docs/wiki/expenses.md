## üí° Practical Usage

### Timely Payments

Our expenses module ensures that all payments are made on time. With **due dates** clearly specified and reminders in place, we significantly reduce the risk of late payments, missed fees, or interest charges.

**Example:**
If a hosting provider invoice is due in 7 days, the system alerts the assigned user 3 days in advance to initiate the payment.

### Payment Tracking

We are able to track **when an expense was paid**, who processed it, and match it with the related vendor and account.

**Example:**
Tracking a payment for annual domain renewal and associating it with the "Infrastructure" vendor account.

### Reminders and Notifications

The CRM sends automated notifications to the responsible users based on the **Due Date** field, ensuring proactive expense management without manual follow-ups.

### Reporting and Analysis

With structured data, we can generate **monthly, quarterly, and annual reports** to:

- Monitor expense trends
- Analyze spending per vendor
- Audit financial performance
- Improve budgeting accuracy

## üîÅ Automation of Recurring Expenses

We have implemented a smart automation feature to handle **repeating expenses**. Based on our recurring payments (such as subscriptions, hosting, etc.), the system automatically creates expenses each month without requiring manual input.

**Benefits:**

- Saves administrative time
- Eliminates human error
- Ensures consistent tracking

**Example:**
A monthly invoice from a cloud hosting provider is auto-generated every first of the month with the correct due date and category.

## üóÇ Expense Types

We categorize each expense based on its nature for better organization and reporting. Below are the available types:

- `Invoice`
- `Receipt`
- `Order`
- `Correction`
- `Taxes`
- `Mandatory Insurance`
- `Other`

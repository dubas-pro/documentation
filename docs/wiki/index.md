# How We Use EspoCRM in Our Business

## Why We’re Sharing This
We wanted to take a moment to share how we use EspoCRM in our day-to-day operations. It’s not just about showcasing what we’ve built—it’s about inspiring others in the community, sparking ideas, or even helping someone decide if EspoCRM is the right fit for their needs. Maybe you’ll find our custom extensions useful, or perhaps you’ll be inspired to create something new. Either way, we hope our experience adds value.

## A Little About Us
We’ve been in the IT world for over 10 years, starting out in the WordPress space. Back then, we were on the hunt for a CRM that could keep up with our growing business. We tried a few options—FengOffice, vTiger, and others—but nothing quite clicked until we found EspoCRM. It was simple yet powerful, and with our technical background, we were able to customize it to fit our needs perfectly.

Over time, EspoCRM became the heart of our operations. We moved away from WordPress entirely and started building custom extensions to make the platform even better. Along the way, we’ve created more than 100 videos to help others get the most out of EspoCRM.

## How EspoCRM Fits Into Our Work
Since our team works mostly remotely, we needed a centralized system to keep everything organized. EspoCRM became that system. We started by using it to manage customer and order details, but it quickly grew into so much more. Now, it handles everything from customer relationships to our ticketing system.

In this section, we’ll walk you through how we’ve set things up—our infrastructure, the modules we use, the custom features we’ve built, and how we’ve integrated it all into our workflow.

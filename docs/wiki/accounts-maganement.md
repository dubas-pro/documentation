## ü§ñ Automations & Workflow Enhancements

### Examples

#### Credit Control Logic

For customers with high overdue balances:

- Payment terms switch from **post-paid** to **pre-paid**.
- Future projects or services are flagged until the balance is cleared.

#### Language-Based Notifications

Emails, task descriptions, and portal messages are automatically localized. Templates use placeholders and translation keys depending on `language` field.

# Managing Leads in EspoCRM

## Introduction

Leads in EspoCRM are a cornerstone of our business processes, helping us manage potential cooperations efficiently. This documentation provides an in-depth look at how we utilize the Leads module in EspoCRM, from initial contact to conversion, ensuring a streamlined and professional experience for both our team and our prospective clients.

## Implementation of Leads in EspoCRM

### Lead Registration

We use EspoCRM’s Leads feature to capture and manage information about potential clients who are not yet part of our system. Leads are created through the following channels:

* **Contact Form**: Submissions via our website’s contact form.
* **Booking Tool**: Meetings scheduled via our booking application.
* **Website Chat**: Interactions initiated through our live chat feature.
* **External Forms**: Data collected through external forms integrated with our CRM.

If the system detects that the individual is not already registered as a Contact, a new Lead is automatically created using the available information.

### Communication and Proposal Management

Once a Lead is created, we leverage EspoCRM to:

* **Communicate via Tickets**: All conversations with the Lead are logged as tickets within the system, ensuring centralized communication.
* **Register Proposals**: New proposals and project scopes can be documented directly under the Lead’s profile.
* **Prepare for Sales**: Information gathered during this phase helps us tailor our sales process to the client’s needs.

### Lead Conversion Process

When a Lead decides to proceed with our proposal, the following steps are triggered:

1. **Customer Registration**:

   * The Lead is required to fill out a form providing essential details such as:

     * Company Name
     * Address
     * Email Address
     * Other relevant information

2. **Verification**:

   * Our team verifies the submitted details to confirm the company’s existence and ensure data accuracy.

3. **Lead Conversion**:

   * Upon successful verification:

     * The Lead is converted into a **Company** and **Contact** within EspoCRM.
     * A portal user account is created, and a password setup link is sent to the new customer via email.

### Retention and Deletion of Leads

If a Lead chooses not to proceed, their information is retained for a limited time before being automatically deleted, in compliance with data protection regulations.

## Benefits of Using Leads in EspoCRM

### Centralized Data Management

* All prospective client information is consolidated within EspoCRM, eliminating the need for disparate systems.
* Streamlined communication through tickets ensures no interaction is lost.

### Enhanced Sales Efficiency

* Clear tracking from Lead to Sale enables us to monitor and improve our sales pipeline.
* The structured process ensures all necessary information is gathered before conversion.

### Compliance and Data Security

* Automated deletion of inactive Leads ensures compliance with GDPR and other data protection regulations.
* Verification steps prevent inaccuracies and enhance the reliability of our client database.

### Practical Example

A recent example illustrates the effectiveness of our Lead management system:

1. A potential client contacted us via the website chat with an inquiry about custom CRM integrations.
2. EspoCRM automatically created a Lead, logging their contact details and initial query.
3. Our team followed up via tickets, registered a proposal, and engaged in discussions.
4. After the proposal was accepted, the client completed the registration form.
5. Verification confirmed the client’s details, leading to a seamless conversion into a Company and Contact, complete with a portal user account.

This process not only streamlined our workflow but also left a positive impression on the client.

## Conclusion

Utilizing Leads in EspoCRM has transformed our approach to managing potential clients, providing a structured, efficient, and secure framework. This system enables us to track every detail from initial contact to final sale, ensuring a professional and seamless experience for our team and clients alike.

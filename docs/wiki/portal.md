# Customer Dashboard (EspoCRM Portal)

To provide our clients with fast, secure, and centralized access to services and support, we‚Äôve built a fully integrated **Customer Dashboard** powered by **EspoCRM's Portal**. This dashboard gives customers a personalized environment to manage licenses, submit requests, access support history, and interact with us - using just one account.

This article outlines how the dashboard works, how access is granted, and what features are available once you're logged in.

## 1. First Contact: From Lead to Customer

When a person contacts us - via **email**, **live chat**, **contact form**, or by **scheduling a meeting** - they are automatically added to our system as a **lead** in EspoCRM.

After discussing the project or service request, we provide a secure registration link to transition from a lead to a customer:

üîó [Register Your Company](https://dashboard.dubas.pro/static/company-registration)

## 2. Registration & Verification Process

Once the registration form is submitted:

- A **verification request** is created in EspoCRM.
- Our team reviews the details, including validation of the company‚Äôs existence and correctness of submitted data.
- Upon successful verification, we approve the request internally.

Then, the system performs the following automated actions:

- Converts the **lead** into a proper **Account** and **Contact**
- Creates a **Portal User**
- Sends a **welcome email** with a secure link to **set your password**

## 3. Single Sign-On (SSO): One Account, Many Services

Our dashboard uses **Single Sign-On (SSO)**, which allows customers to use one account across all our platforms, including:

- The **customer dashboard**
- Our **e-commerce system**
- Company **forms and applications**
- Future integrated services

After setting your password, simply visit [dashboard.dubas.pro](https://dashboard.dubas.pro) and click **Sign In**.

## 4. Role-Based Access Control

To manage access based on responsibilities within your company, we assign specific **roles** to each user. These roles define what data and features a user can access:

### Available Roles

- **Owner** ‚Äì Full visibility and control over company-wide data, settings, and users.
- **Billing** ‚Äì Access to invoices, transactions, and billing details.
- **Regular** ‚Äì Access to personal profile and communication history.

## 5. Dashboard Features Overview

Once logged in, the customer dashboard provides access to multiple tools and features:

### üéü Access to Support Tickets

All communication with our team is managed via our internal **EspoCRM Ticketing System**. Within the dashboard, customers can:

- View open and closed tickets
- Review conversation history
- Monitor ticket status
- Reply to support directly through the portal

### üì¶ Access to Purchased Licenses

Customers who purchase our extensions or services are granted access to a **Licenses** section within the dashboard. From here, they can:

- View a list of purchased products
- Download the latest versions of extensions
- Track license activation and expiration status

This ensures that downloads and updates are always accessible in a secure and convenient way.

### üìù Access to Company Forms

Many of our internal and customer service forms - such as those used to request consultations, submit RFPs, or schedule calls - require account authentication.

After logging into the dashboard:

- Customers gain **automatic access** to authenticated forms
- All form submissions are **linked to the user‚Äôs account**
- Data is prefilled when possible to streamline the process

This centralized access improves efficiency and eliminates the need to fill out the same information multiple times.

## 6. Portal Access & Data Visibility

For performance and data management, some limitations apply within the portal:

- **Time-based filtering**: Users may only see records from the **last X months**
- **Role-specific visibility**: Users only see data appropriate to their assigned roles
- **Archived data**: Older items may be archived and accessible upon request

These measures help keep the dashboard clean, fast, and secure for all users.

## Summary

Our Customer Dashboard, built with EspoCRM‚Äôs Portal, is more than just a support tool - it's a centralized access point for all your interactions with us. Whether you need to download licenses, submit a ticket, fill out a company form, or manage billing, everything is accessible with a single account.

We‚Äôre constantly working to improve your experience. If you have questions or feedback, feel free to reach out through any communication channel or use the **Help** section within the dashboard.
